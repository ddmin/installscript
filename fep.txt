# Frequently Encountered Problems

1. Ranger returns an error code
        I aliased ranger to 'ranger && wal'. Probably has something to do with wal

2. Can't access Cinnamon settings
        You have to downgrade the PIL to 5.4.1

3. Weather info not displaying in the homepage
        Set mixed content to false in about:config

4. What's the command for rofi?
        `rofi -modi drun -show drun -show-icons`

5. Get rid of Gnome-Terminal titlebar?
        run `gsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Settings headerbar "@mb false"`
